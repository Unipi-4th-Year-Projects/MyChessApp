# MyChessApp
A university project about making a Chess app in Windowns Forms. Time control and playing with a bot (random moves) are available in the app (extras). 

Game ends when someone resigns (or ties) and not with checkmate or stalemate. Assignment also asked us to not force the user to play legal moves. Although, the app suggest the legal moves to the player.
